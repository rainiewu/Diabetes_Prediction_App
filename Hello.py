    ### Background
    Diabetes affects how our body turns food into energy through insufficient production of insulin, leading to high blood sugar. If left untreated, it can lead to kidney disease, heart disease, and vision loss over time. It is also the eighth leading cause of death in the US, affecting about 11.3% of the US population with about 28.7 million people diagnosed and 8.5 million undiagnosed. Cases in adults have more than doubled in the last 20 years.  
    
    There are three types of diabetes and the risk factors are as follow:

    #### Type 1 diabetes 
    - No known prevention as mainly autoimmune
